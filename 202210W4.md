### Tom Fitzpatrick-Year 3 weee=k 35 Plausible Deniablity
Although Nick Timiraos mention the fed will consider 50bp raise for Dec meeting, it is more like a free option which give Fed the room to act by data(mainly CPI and Employment). Market might be over-reactted to this news. Data will not co-op with their thoughts. Rate end will be 5.75-6.0%.
### Rui Ding-Another reason to fade the EUR rally: PMI
PMI number crash in Germany and EuroZone. Inidicating downside risks to current growth expectation. PMI and ZEW both show Germany got stuck in deeper recession. Firms' concern centered around energy costs, high inflation, rising interest rate and prospect of recession. EURUSD now is near resistance levels with 55d MA and parity. ECB hiking 75bps will not be suffcient to push EUR higher and US yield will increase.
###  Vasileios Gkionakis-ECB playbook
- EURUSD is mainly driven by short-term US yield. The correlation with GE rate is negative. Fed's move make global growth expectation lower. ECB rate hike will weaken the currency.
- GE 2s5s, BTP-Bund spread is widening
- Fed will continue increase rate and 2Y will go to 5% according to historical experience
- Net long CFTC holdings before meeting. Make the bar for euro to risk as a response to higher-than-expected hike is quite high.
