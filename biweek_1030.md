Past two weeks witness a continuous deline of dollar(DXY@110.6), ending its 4-month streak of weekly gains. The main driver is the cooling of Fed rate hike expectations. Some U.S. economic data was lower than expected and some Fed officials disagreed on the rate hike rate before the Fed entered the silent period. In addition, as the market’s expectations for the Fed’s turnaround have gradually increased, risk assets represented by U.S. stocks have risen sharply again, and the U.S. dollar has also lost its favor from safe-haven funds and has fallen under pressure. 
On the Euro side, with the inflation data showing that European inflation pressure is still at a historically high level, a series of ECB officials have successively issued hawkish remarks, and the market's expectations for ECB interest rate hikes have continued to rise. In addition, the price of natural gas continued the trend of falling from the high level at the end of August in October, which also supported the rebound of the euro; it is worth noting that the rebound of the euro broke through the upper limit of the downward trend channel since the beginning of the year for the first time this year, which also shows that the previous extreme bearish sentiment on the euro has clearly begun to weaken. However, the October ECB conference expressed some dovish signal to the market, which caused a little bit drawback of Euro, which ended up at 0.9965.

Another driver is the above-consensus CPI number, which increased by 0.2pp to 10.1% yoy in September.
